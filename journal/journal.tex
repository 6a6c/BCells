\section{October 3rd, 2022}
* Began by creating jupyternotebook for replicating model (boy howdy is installing jupyter annoying)
\\
* Created a basic model using the equations described and solved it with the Euler method. Lots of stackoverflowing and wikipediaing.
\\
* Using some of the fits sent to me could not replicate results (often with solutions that are wildly different)
\\
* Need more time working on this a figuring out fits. Spent about 4 hours today

\section{October 4th, 2022}
* Worked more with toying around w/ fits and trying to figure out what works best. 
\\
* Some of the fits given really make no sense at all. E.g, mu of 10 million makes the model diverge to infinity. fM > 1 makes no sense
\\
* Added scatter plot to help visualize data
\\
* Need to make some way of fitting variables (figure out how gradient descent works again). Spent about 1.5 hours

\section{October 5th, 2022}
* Implemented a gradient descent. Or rather, tried to. It didn't work. It would never descend the gradient. 
I have no idean what I did wrong but I spent about 5 hours all to get nothing out of it.

\section{October 7th, 2022}
* Emailed Dr. Ganusov and got a response that helped me fit the model better. (i.e. how to fit mu and f_M)
\\
* To fit Plasmablast population, he adds B0 to B(t). This seems weird to me as it implies that there exists a population of plasma blasts that can never die.
\\
* Got gradient descent to work. I had an extra "r" in an array. Gradient descent with respect to SSR doesn't seem to help that much, will have to try it with NLL.
